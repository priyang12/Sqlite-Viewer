# Sqlite Viewer

A lightweight offline web application for browsing and inspecting SQLite databases right in your browser. Built using modern React, sql.js, and fully installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Features

- Load and explore .db files directly in the browser.

- Visualize relationships between tables.

- Build and run custom SQL queries using a visual interface or raw SQL.

- Export data as CSV.

- Offline support via IndexedDB.

- Installable as a PWA. (Add to Home Screen)

## Toolset for Working with Databases

The application provides three powerful tools to interact with SQLite databases:

### 1. Tables View

- Explore and interact with your database tables

- Filter, sort, pin, reorder, and resize columns
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Column headers display:
  - Primary key icons
  - Foreign key indicators
  - Data type icons (if mapped)

### 2. Charts View

- Visualize table structure and relationships.

- Built with @xyflow/react
- Tables are rendered as draggable nodes on a canvas
- Foreign key relationships are automatically detected and visualized
- Columns display associated data types

### 3. Query Builder

- Build and run custom SQL queries using an interactive UI

- Visual query builder with intuitive components
- Query history panel tracks previously created queries
- Optional raw SQL editor using CodeMirror
- Validate and execute queries
- View query results in the Tables view
